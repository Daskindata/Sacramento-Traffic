#Sacramento Traffic

Live video feeds from live street cameras in the City of Sacramento, divided the road into zones [pedestrian walkway, curb parking, bicycle lane and 2 road lanes] and applied AI algorithms to identify and track objects of different classes [pedestrian, bicycle, car, bus and truck]. Video footage was converted into numeric data in CSV format. Statistical modelling was undertaken using a number of different methods, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Regression in investigating a solution. 

There were four main questions of interest to the parking management of the City of Sacramento:
1.	How to reduce or eliminate double-parking
2.	How to manage the occupancy rate of vehicles in on-road parking spaces
3.	What parking prices and time limits to use to manage parking
4.	How to ensure road users stick to their own zones such as bicycles use the bike lane rather than the walkway.
