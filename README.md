#Sacramento Traffic

Live video feeds from live street cameras in the City of Sacramento, divided the road into zones [pedestrian walkway, curb parking, bicycle lane and 2 road lanes] and applied AI algorithms to identify and track objects of different classes [pedestrian, bicycle, car, bus and truck]. Video footage was converted into numeric data in CSV format. Statistical modelling was undertaken using a number of different methods, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Regression.
